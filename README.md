# ocfl-index

`ocfl-index` is a command line tool for indexing [OCFL Storage Roots](https://ocfl.io). It can be used to index and query the [logical state](https://ocfl.io/1.0/spec/#dfn-logical-state) of objects in a storage root. The index is stored as a sqlite3 database (see `sqlite/schema.sql` for details). 

*This is work in progress*. 

```
Usage:
  ocfl-index [command]

Available Commands:
  benchmark   benchmark indexing with generated inventories
  help        Help about any command
  index       index an OCFL storage root
  query       query the index

Flags:
  -f, --file string   index filename/connection string (default "index.sqlite")
  -h, --help          help for ocfl-index

Use "ocfl-index [command] --help" for more information about a command.

## Indexing

You can index OCFL storage roots on the local filesystem or an S3 object store.

```sh
# index a storage root locally
ocfl-index index --dir ~/my/root

# index a storage root on s3 (first set environment variables)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= ... 
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_REGION=...
export AWS_S3_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:9000" # for non-aws S3 endpoint
ocfl-index index --s3-bucket my-bucket --s3-path store-prefix
```

## Querying
To query, use the `query [object-id] [path]` subcommand. The path should be a *relative* path (using `/` as a separator) referencing a file or directory in the object. Use the `-v` flag to query the object at a particular version.

```sh
# list all objects in the index
ocfl-index query

# list all versions in an object
ocfl-index query object-id

# list names of files and directories in the root of an object's most recent version
ocfl-index query object-id "."

# list names in the 'foo' directory of the object's first version
ocfl-index query object-id "foo" -v v1
```

## Benchmarking

The benchmark command can be used to get a sense of the performance characteristics of the index. It uses generated inventories with randomized states to build the index, measuring average times for index and query operations. Itâ€™s also useful for getting a sense of how the index file grows in size as you add inventories. 

```sh
# example with 1000 inventories
ocfl-index benchmark --size 100 --num 1000

indexing 1000 generated inventories (1-4 versions, 100 files/version)
indexed 1000/1000 (0.16 sec/op avg)
queried 99 paths (0.0004 sec/op avg)
benchmark complete in 164.5 sec
```

## S3 Config

AWS credentials can be set with the `aws` cli. You may also use the following environment variables:

```sh
# Access Key ID
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= ... 
# Secret Access Key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SECRET
# Region
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
# for non-aws S3 endpoint
AWS_S3_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:9000"
```
